# Joshu

Joshu is a custom Discord bot with a variety of features. It's built on a system
of declarative command modules, has built-in request validation (including
command parameter types), auto-generated help pages for commands, and
suggestions for misspelled command names.

## Can I invite Joshu to my server?

Not at the moment, sorry. Some of the commands are a bit too specific to our
private server. You are welcome to use the codebase as a starting point for your
own self-hosted bot, though.
